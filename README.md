## Battleship
A simple project of the popular game. Mobile and Desktop mode.

### Inspiration
Source: "Head First JavaScript Programming" 2014 (2015 PL version), chapter 8
My version of game in React.

### How to play?
1) Player shoots to sink all ships.
2) Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. 
3) The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship (Carrier - 5, Battleship - 4, Submarine - 3, Destroyer - 2).  The grid size and the number of the ships are different on different devices: 

#### Desktop
* 10x10 grid
* ships: Carrier x1, Battleship x1, Submarine x2, Destroyer x2

#### Mobile 
* 6x6 grid
* ships: Battleship x1, Submarine x1, Destroyer x1
